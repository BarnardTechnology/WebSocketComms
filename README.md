# WebSocketComms

A simple Websocket server to allow easy communication between a web browser and server by
abstracting the underlying comms layer, allowing the programmer to write methods on both
the client and server which can then be exposed to the opposing party. It is then possible
to call these methods in almost the same way as calling a method locally.

Still very much in development, although it does work - just lacking documentation!
